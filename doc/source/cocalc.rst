FriCAS in COCALC (formerly SageMathCloud)
=========================================

You can try FriCAS commands online in
`CoCalc <http://cocalc.com>`_.

You have to create a Sage Worksheet. Then prepend before every
FriCAS command a line

  '%fricas'

so that your command is not interpreted as a Sage command, but
rather as a FriCAS command.

Look at a
`FriCAS Demo <https://cocalc.com/projects/2b347771-02da-4d24-bfa8-a0d9d1ecb1df/files/demo-fricas.sagews>`_.
